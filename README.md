# FinalProject-Prototype

This visualizer was created from a YouTube tutorial, but I haven't had the time to alter it yet to look the way that I want it to. Also, for the interactivity I'm going to incorporate what we learned from the JS-Slider tutorials to alter the different aspects of the visualizer itself.
